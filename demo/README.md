# Logging Demo

This directory contains a small demonstration of a logging system that makes use
of user-specified scope tags for tracing. For testing purposes, it also contains
logic to capture logged content. See [`main.cc`](main.cc) for the main program
and [`test.cc`](test.cc) for the corresponding unit test.
